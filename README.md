# Azure OpenAI GPT-4 / ChatGPT API

A simple RESTful API of GPT-4 / ChatGPT with Azure OpenAI Service, build with TypeScript and Node.js Express

:warning: Design for testing and internal use only. :warning:

## Features
- Base on Azure OpenAI Service REST API
- Simple, easy to use, one endpoint only
- Flexible for future extension and development
- Logit bias & function call are not supported yet
- RESTful API structure
- Build with TypeScript, Node.js, Express

## API doc

### Chat Completions
- Request Method: `POST`
- API Endpoint: `/v1/gpt/chat`

#### Request Body

> Only prompt/userPrompt is required, all other params are optional.

| Param Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | string | N/A | Alias of `userPrompt` |
| `userPrompt` | string | N/A | User prompt input for chat completions |
| `systemPrompt` | string | N/A | System prompt to instruct or set the behavior of the assistant |
| `assistantPrompt` | string | N/A | Assistant prompt provides responses to system-instructed, user-prompted input |
| `temperature` | number | 1 *(A)* | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.\nWe generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. |
| `top_p` | number | 1 *(A)* | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. |
| `n` | integer | 1 *(A)* | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. |
| `stream` | boolean | false *(A)* | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message." |
| `stop` | string / array | null *(A)* | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. |
| `max_tokens` | integer | inf *(A)* | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens). |
| `presence_penalty` | number | 0 *(A)* | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
| `frequency_penalty` | number | 0 *(A)* | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. |
| `user` | string | N/A | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Azure OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. |
